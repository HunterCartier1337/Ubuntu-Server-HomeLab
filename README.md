## <a name="intro"></a>Intro: The Home-Labtop
I turned my old gaming laptop into an Ubuntu server for practice. I've been using Linux for a over a year now starting back with VM's in Virtual Box. Then I upgraded to downloading an ISO with a USB stick and putting Linux Mint on both my laptops and dual booting my desktop. Then I took my stab at Linux+ and passed. Now while I don't care much for the certification I did learn a lot more about Linux in the process of studying for it. I then bought book about Ubuntu server and learned even more to add to my previous studying. And that is what brought me here. Finally testing some of what I had learned. I don't have fancy hardware for this home lab.. yet. I used this as more of a test. This setup I have is very temporary while I look into a more long-term solution as I continue to learn and figure out what I am after. So far I setup Samba, NFS, MariaDB, and Apache2 with my own web page that I made for guests to visit when connected to our WiFi. I then installed a new SSD and partitioned it with fdisk. I had a lot of fun with this and plan on doing more in the future.
